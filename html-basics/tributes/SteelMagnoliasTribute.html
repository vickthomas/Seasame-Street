            <h2 class="subheading">Plot</h2>
            <p class="text">Steel Magnolias is a 1989 feel good comedy about a group of women in northwest Louisiana.
                Starring Dolly Parton (Truvy Jones), Olympia Dukakis (Clairee Belcher), Shirley MacLaine (Ouiser
                Boudreaux), Darryl Hannah (Annelle Dupuy), Sally Field (M'Lynn Eatenton), and Julia Roberts (Shelby
                Eatenton). The movie was nominated for several awards and went on to gross more than $83.7 million
                there.</p>

            <p class="text">The movie begins just before Shelby's (Julia Roberts) wedding to Jackson (Dylan McDermott).
                It takes place mainly in Truvy's Beauty Parlor. It covers events over the next several years, including
                Shelby's decision to have a son despite being diabetic and the consequences that resulted from the
                decision.
            </p>

            <p>The movie goes into the friendship of the women who regularly gather at Truvy's Beauty Parlor. The
                unlikely friendship between Clairee and Ouiser; Annelle's transformations from a shy, anxious young
                woman, to a partying one, then to a religious fanatic; and Truvy's relationships with her son and
                husband (or lack there of). Although the main storyline involves Shelby and her mother, M'Lynn, the
                underlying group friendship is prominent throughout the film.</p>

            <h2 class="subheading">Facts About 'Steel Magnolias' Even Die-Hard Fans Don't Know</h2>

            <ul>
                <li class="steel-mag-factoid">Steel Magnolias' was based on a true story. Actor and writer Robert
                    Harling wrote the play based on the true story of his sister, Susan Harling Robinson, who died from
                    complications with diabetes.</li>

                <li class="steel-mag-factoid">It took 10 days to write. "The events that inspired it were so powerful
                    that, after I found the story arena, it just poured out into my typewriter in a 24/7 tsunami of
                    Southernness", Harling told Garden & Gun in 2013 about the speedy writing process. "I had no idea
                    what I'd written. I asked the first person I gave it to if it even looked like a play. I wasn't
                    really sure. All I knew was that I felt it portrayed my sister's life and spirit accurately, and
                    that was enough for me."</li>

                <li class="steel-mag-factoid">The film sparked a real-life romance. The sparks you saw between Roberts
                    and her on-screen beau Dylan McDermott were real. When filming began on Steel Magnolias, Roberts was
                    dating actor Liam Neeson, her co-star in Satisfaction. Then, according to People, she allegedly
                    broke up with Neeson to date—and eventually become engaged to—McDermott. They never made it to the
                    altar, though, with their relationship ending in 1990.</li>

            <ol>

                <li>Friends accept each other's faults. The women all loved Ouiser even though she admitted that she had
                    "been in a very bad mood 40 years." Her grouchiness was simply a part of her, and her friends
                    accepted it graciously, like Clairee asking, "Ouiser, you sound almost chipper. What happened
                    today—you run over a small child or something?"</li>

                <li>There's no use in trying to keep secrets between friends. Whether it's a pregnancy, an "affair with
                    a Mercedes Benz", or a kidney donation, friends can't keep secrets from each other—and shouldn't
                    bother trying.</li>

                <li> You don't need to have the same interests as your friends.Ouiser and Clairee were great friends,
                    even though Clairee's idea of fun was a weekend checking out the Broadway shows in New York City and
                    Ousier, well, this is what she had to say about that, "I don't see plays, because I can nap at home
                    for free."</li>

                <li>Friendships are the most powerful thing in the world.Friends can carry you through the toughest
                    moments in life and have you come out laughing on the other end, or as Truvy said, "Laughter through
                    tears is my favorite emotion."</li>

            </ol>
