      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>Gabby is an Instagram famous socialite who descended from the landed gentry<br>
        She's that classic girl who's had everything you could ever buy, 
        but never had what<br>
        she probably needs... which love from her father, 
        who's been absent her entire life.</p> <br>
        
        <p>Beneath her poise
        and polished exterior is a young woman who surrounds herself<br>
        with people who don't really have her 
        best interests at heart; she has deep-seated<br>
        issues ranging from substance addiction to anger management. Though the<br>
        behavior feels
        all about her trying to be noticed and loved. And she 
        surrounds<br> herself with people
        who don't really have her 
        best interests at heart.</p>
        <p>She's fascinating. She's hilarious. She's a great one for a cause but without really<br>
        understanding the cause. She's just gets behind something and hilariously gets it<br>
        wrong all the time. She's always saying the wrong things without really 
        knowing<br>
        what she's saying, which adds to her hilarity and charm.</p>
        <p>Her time with the outlaws turns out to be 
            life-defining for her.</p>
